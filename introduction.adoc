== Introduction

This specification delineates the operation parameters according the general PLIC
architecture defined in the RISC-V platform-level interrupt controller (PLIC)
specification (was removed from https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/download/draft-20181201-5449851/riscv-privileged.pdf[RISC-V Privileged Spec v1.11-draft])
to work in the context of RISC-V systems. +
The PLIC multiplexes various device interrupts onto the external interrupt lines
of Hart contexts, with hardware support for interrupt priorities. PLIC supports
up-to 1023 interrupts (0 is reserved) and 15872 contexts, but the actual number of
interrupts and context depends on the PLIC implementation. However, the implementation
must adhere to the offset of each register within the PLIC operation parameters.
The PLIC which claimed as PLIC-Compliant standard PLIC should follow the 
implementations mentioned in sections below.
